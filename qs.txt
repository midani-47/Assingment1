in #TODO under def add_newspaper
how to implement?
is it:
    def add_newspaper(self, new_paper: Newspaper):
        #TODO: assert that ID does not exist  yet (or create a new one)
        if new_paper.paper_id in [paper.paper_id for paper in self.newspapers]:
            raise Exception(f"Newspaper with ID {new_paper.paper_id} already exists")
        self.newspapers.append(new_paper)
?


*in newspaperNS:
# TODO: this is not smart! you should find a better way to generate a unique ID!


*app.py
    # need to extend this class for custom objects, so that they can be jsonified
    class CustomJSONEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
        def default(self, obj):
            if isinstance(obj, Agency):
                return obj.__dict__
            return json.JSONEncoder.default(self, obj)

* delete the newspaper and ALL ITS ISSUES?


* defining lists in constructor


* in newspaper.py  shouldn't the paper_id be a list? so you can eventually append subscribers to it?


* Specify an editor for an issue. (Transmit the editor ID as parameter)
